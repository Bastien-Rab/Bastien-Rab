👋 Hi, I’m @Bastien-Rab
👀 I’m interested in data analytics, project management, and digital transformation, especially within the banking and finance sector.

🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics through OpenClassrooms, gaining skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects that involve business process optimization and change management.

📫 How to reach me: bastien@rabane.fr

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy long-distance running, from marathons to ultratrails, and I've traveled around the world, visiting 13 countries in one year.
